If you are a new to my pages, I should prevent you that I am trying to express myself and but all the Technical and Computer Science bull***t a side.
That was the introduction😁 , so after few years of working on various projects and specially “innovative” projects. I have faced a lot of difficulties. and in many occasions I felt like some peoples around are trying to stop the team, or at least slow it down, let say that they are “old” so they can’t move fast!!
(I usually project concepts on the mother nature, and try to link between the society and the jungle. It is just to convince myself that I am right about the human is at the end an animal that can hurt and destroy.)
Back to the subject 🤷‍♀️, I have noticed that the old is in the most of time trying to mark his presence and prove that he is valuable to the group, because he is obsessed about the idea of “abandonation” , he thinks that the group will drop him down, on this particular point the old does score a point , because that what happens in the jungle (society).
So the old to pushes the button and trying to impose his ideas on the group, and in many case without any arguments. the only arguments that he gives (without letting it out). “I am more experienced than you folks…. you must listen and respect🤦‍♂️”.Even that the old is right he is the most experienced, but it does not mean that he is the best! otherwise we will be watching NBA games where the average age is 69 years old🤢 .
We can understand the old’s behavior, and the only justification for such behavior is that he is afraid to get fired! and he will get fired anyway! because companies like Microsoft and Google they don’t keep this kind of people inside for two reasons : innovation needs fresh minds, old profiles cost more money than young folks.
This the other side the young 🤠 with all the energy in his blood, he need to be controlled, in other words he needs a code, the code that will put him/her on the good track.
I don’t like to compare between the young and the old but since it is the jungle so f*** it, let’s start by the old 🤓. In the big business the old has been doing the work for so long and he is familiar with the protocols (the Code), not only familiar he doesn’t see the code as a restriction any more. imagine you are living in small town and one day you went out and the town closed from the world like in the TV show The Colony! you will be trying to go out and break the walls surround your town, but let’s say that you got a baby, your baby wont never try to go out since he will grow up in the town with all he need.
Keep the previous example (Colony) in mind and let’s say that the old is the baby and you are the young 🤠 that has learned on internet online courses new technologies or new programming languages. you will feel like you don’t have enough papers to express your ideas.
Now there are two reasons causing this situation:
1- It is the speed on technology evolution that we the humans we can’t fellow up. this speed gap makes us talk about old and young otherwise the old would learn the new techs and be in same level as the young. (the young wont need to learn all what the old knew , he only need the fundamentals #basics). However the main reason is that the code is something sacred and no one can change it (anyone can change it🤷‍♂️ ).
Putting the jungle a side in the perfect world the old must stay and contribute because is masters the Code, and give the chance to the young to develop, create and innovate for the best of the business👌 .
